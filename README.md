# Algomorph

A Scala library exploreing algorithms as morphisms: transforming inputs to outputs with functional, stack-safe, and both immutable and mutable data structures.

Includes:
 * graph algorithms
 * combinatorial functions
 * number-theoretic operations, and
 * algebraic abstractions.

Many structures and functions provide dual implementations—mutable for in-place efficiency,
immutable for safety—showcasing advanced functional programming techniques,
stack-safe recursion via trampolines and CPS, and flexible algorithm design.
