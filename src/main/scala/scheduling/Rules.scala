  /**
   * Combines multiples rules into a single rule, accumulating all errors.
   *
   * ===Monoidal Properties===
   *
   * `allOf` gives `Rule` monoidal properties:
   *   - `allOf()` returns the identity rule
   *   - identity: for all rules, rule == allOf(id, rule) == allOf(rule, id)
   *   - associativity: for all rules, allOf(allOf(rule1, rule2), rule3) == allOf(rule1, allOf(rule2, rule3))
   *
   * Benefits:
   *   - Composability: Complex rules can be composed from simple ones
   *   - Predictability: Rules can be combined in any order (associativity), and all errors aggregated
   *
   * Non commutative: allOf(rule1, rule2) != allOf(rule2, rule1) - errors in the resulting list may have different ordering.
   *
   * ===Complexity===
   *
   * Worst-, average- and best-case time complexities are the same: every schedule is checked against all rules.
   *   - Time: Θ(n*m) - where m = size of schedules and n = size of rules

  /**
   * Combine multiple rules into a single rule, returning errors from the first rule violation only.
   *
   * ===Properties===
   *
   * `firstOf` obeys the identity laws:
   *   - `firstOf()` returns the identity rule
   *   - identity: for all rules, rule == firstOf(id, rule) == firstOf(rule, id)
   *
   * It is non-associative and non-commutative (ordering matters).
   *
   * Benefits:
   *   - Short-circuiting; Stops evaluation as soon as the first rule violation is found
   *   - Deterministic: Earlier rules take precedence over subsequent ones.
   *
   * ===Complexity===
   *
   * The time complexity ranges from Θ(m) to Θ(n*m), where m = size of schedules and n = size of rules. For best-performance,
   * place frequently failing rules first.
